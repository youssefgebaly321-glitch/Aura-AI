| 🐧 **Linux Support** | Port Win32 stealth APIs to X11/Wayland equivalents |
| 🍎 **macOS Support** | Port Win32 stealth APIs to Cocoa/AppKit |

| 🎨 **UI/UX** | Improve the overlay interface, themes, animations |

## 📐 Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 conventions
- **JavaScript**: Use vanilla JS (no frameworks in the frontend)
- **CSS**: Vanilla CSS — no Tailwind or preprocessors
- **Naming**: Descriptive variable/function names, snake_case for Python, camelCase for JS
- **Comments**: Explain *why*, not *what* — code should be self-documenting

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Never commit secrets** — `.env` and `ai_providers.json` are in `.gitignore` for a reason
- **Test stealth features** on Windows 10/11 before submitting stealth-related PRs
- **Keep PRs focused** — one feature or fix per PR
- **Be respectful** — we're all here to build something awesome
