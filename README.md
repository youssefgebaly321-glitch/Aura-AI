## ✨ What is Aura?

Aura isn't just another interview prep tool. It's your secret weapon for **any challenge**—from aptitude tests to quantitative brain-twisters, behavioral showdowns to certification exams. Aura is a **revolutionary AI assistant** that operates in real-time, providing candidates with the critical insights they need to excel in high-stakes situations—all without ever tripping tab-switching warnings, thanks to its stealthy, seamless design.

Imagine having a world-class expert whispering in your ear, helping you deconstruct complex problems, articulate your thoughts, and navigate the toughest questions with confidence. **That's Aura.**

### How It Works

Aura sits on top of your screen as an **invisible overlay** during live interviews and exams. It **listens** to conversations in real-time via Deepgram speech-to-text, **generates** intelligent coaching responses using blazing-fast LLMs (Groq, Cerebras, Gemini), and lets you **screenshot** any problem for instant Vision AI solutions—all while staying **completely hidden** from screen recordings, proctoring software, and human observers.

### 👻 Stealth Mode in Action

See how Aura overlays **directly on top of LeetCode** during a live coding session — invisible to screen recordings, fully transparent, and controlled entirely via hotkeys.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

<div align="center">
  <img src="Media/transparency-8.png" alt="Aura Stealth — Screen Share Protection" width="370" />
</div>

**Screen Share Protection** — Aura runs during a live LeetCode session with "Share Entire Screen" active. The Aura window overlays the coding environment but is **excluded from the screen capture** via `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE`. Notice the "Microphone Muted" status bar and model switcher visible only to the user.

</td>
<td width="50%">

<div align="center">
  <img src="Media/transparency-9 - max trasnparency.png" alt="Aura Stealth — Maximum Transparency Overlay" width="370" />
</div>

**Maximum Transparency Mode** — With `Alt+1` (40% opacity), Aura becomes a near-invisible ghost overlay. The Live Interview Session indicator, MUTED/RESET controls, and AI model badges (`Primary: Cerebras`) are barely visible — just enough for you, completely invisible to anyone observing your screen. The LeetCode problem beneath is fully readable.

### 🌐 OpenRouter (Optional — Multi-Provider Gateway)

OpenRouter acts as a **gateway** to multiple providers through a single API key. Route specific models through preferred backends (e.g., Llama via Cerebras for speed).

| **Free tier** | Many free models available |
| **Best for** | Unified access to multiple providers + custom routing |

### 💡 Why Use Multiple API Keys? (Free Reliability Hack)

Aura supports **multiple API keys per provider** via the `apiKeys` array in `ai_providers.json`:

```json
"apiKeys": ["KEY_1", "KEY_2", "KEY_3"]
```

**Why this is a game-changer:**

| Benefit | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| **Rate limit resilience** | Free tiers have per-key rate limits. Multiple keys = Aura rotates between them, multiplying your throughput |
| **Zero downtime** | If one key hits its limit, Aura auto-switches to the next — you never notice |
| **No cost** | All providers above offer free keys. Create 2–3 accounts, add all keys — instant reliability |
| **Auto-failover** | Aura also fails over between *providers* (Cerebras → Groq → Gemini), not just keys |

**A single key works perfectly fine** — multiple keys are optional but recommended for heavy use.

> **🏆 Recommended setup:** 2–3 free keys from **Cerebras** (primary, fastest) + 2–3 from **Groq** (secondary + vision) + 1 from **Gemini** (vision backup). **Total cost: $0. Reliability: bulletproof.**

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 📄 Environment Variables (`.env`)

The app **auto-creates** `.env` from `.env.example` on first run.

```env
# ─── API Keys ───
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="your_key"              # Required — Deepgram speech-to-text

# ─── Logging ───
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                            # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR

# ─── Development ───
DEV_MODE=false                            # Verbose logging & dev shortcuts

# ─── AI Behaviour ───
TRACK_CANDIDATE_RESPONSES=true            # Track what the candidate says
INCLUDE_CONVERSATION_HISTORY=true         # Send conversation history to AI
MAX_CONVERSATION_HISTORY=6                # Past exchanges to include (6–20)
GENERATE_FULL_ANSWERS=true                # Full answers vs. brief hints
PERSONALIZE_ANSWERS=true                  # Tailor to your resume/JD

# ─── Stealth / Proctoring ───
ENABLE_SYSTEM_TRAY=false
START_IN_STEALTH_MODE=true

# ─── Scroll Speed (Alt+Up/Down) ───
SCROLL_SPEED_PX=200                       # Pixels per tick
SCROLL_INTERVAL_MS=50                     # Ms between ticks
```

#### 📜 Scroll Speed Presets

Fine-tune how scrolling feels during a live interview:

| Feel | `SCROLL_SPEED_PX` | `SCROLL_INTERVAL_MS` |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 🐢 Slow & precise | `100` | `80` |
| ⚡ Default | `200` | `50` |
| 🚀 Fast scanning | `400` | `30` |

### 🤖 AI Providers (`ai_providers.json`)

Created from `ai_providers.example.json`. **Not committed to git** — your keys stay private.

#### Pre-configured Providers

| Provider | Text Models | Vision Models | Speed |
|----------|------------|---------------|-------|
| **Cerebras** | GPT-OSS 120B, Llama 3.3 70B, Qwen 3 32B | ❌ | ⚡⚡⚡ Fastest |
| **Groq** | GPT-OSS 120B, Llama 3.3 70B, Llama 4 Scout | Llama 4 Scout/Maverick | ⚡⚡ Very fast |
| **Gemini** | Gemini 2.0/2.5/3 Flash | All Gemini models | ⚡ Fast |
| **OpenRouter** | Route to any provider | Via routing | Varies |

#### Provider Schema

```jsonc
{
  "name": "ProviderName",
  "baseURL": "https://api.provider.com/openai/v1",
  "apiKey": "YOUR_KEY",                    // Single key (minimum)
  "apiKeys": ["KEY_1", "KEY_2", "KEY_3"],  // Multiple keys for rotation
  "models": ["model-a", "model-b"],
  "visionModels": ["vision-model-a"],
  "supportsVision": true,
  "defaultModel": "model-a"
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>🎤 Microphone not working</b></summary>

1. Check Windows privacy: **Settings → Privacy → Microphone → Allow apps**
2. Verify `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` in `.env` is correct
3. Close other apps with mic access (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
4. In dev mode (`DEV_MODE=true`), check browser console (F12) for errors
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 AI responses failing or slow</b></summary>

1. Verify API keys in `ai_providers.json` aren't placeholders
2. Press `Alt + E` to auto-select best available model
3. Add more API keys to `apiKeys` array — you may be hitting rate limits
4. Check terminal for error messages
5. App auto-fails over to secondary model — if both fail, check internet
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>👁️ Vision AI not working</b></summary>

1. Ensure a vision-capable provider is configured (Gemini or Groq with Llama 4)
2. Enter vision mode (`Alt + V`) *before* capturing (`Alt + S`)
3. Process the queue (`Alt + P`) after capturing
4. Check `supportsVision: true` in your provider config
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🖥️ Window not visible</b></summary>

1. Press `Alt + Z` to toggle visibility
2. Press `Alt + 3` for 100% opacity (may be transparent)
3. Some fullscreen apps override always-on-top — try windowed mode
4. Re-enable stealth with `Alt + Shift + S`
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📜 Scrolling too fast or slow</b></summary>

Adjust in `.env` and restart:
```env
SCROLL_SPEED_PX=150      # Lower = slower
SCROLL_INTERVAL_MS=70    # Higher = less frequent
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 App won't start</b></summary>

1. Use `run.bat` — it handles venv and deps automatically
2. Verify Python 3.8+ is installed and in PATH
3. Recreate venv: `rmdir /s venv` then `python -m venv venv`
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` manually
</details>
